Test Case: disk_os_import_managed_disk_update
================================================================================

Step 2 Failed: Baseline AzureRM test failed

Initial Error:
Error: Invalid index

  on azurerm.tf line 10, in resource "azurerm_windows_virtual_machine" "test":
  10:   os_managed_disk_id = data.azurerm_managed_disks.test.disk.0.id
    ├────────────────
    │ data.azurerm_managed_disks.test.disk is empty list of object

The given key does not identify an element in this collection value: the collection has no elements.

Root Cause Analysis:
This test case is attempting to reference a managed disk that doesn't exist in the resource group. The configuration uses `data.azurerm_managed_disks.test.disk.0.id` to import an existing managed disk into a new VM, but the data source returns an empty list because no managed disks exist in the newly created resource group.

The test name "diskOSImportManagedDiskUpdate" suggests this is an UPDATE test case that depends on a previous test step or configuration that would have created the managed disk. This test cannot run as a standalone configuration.

This is a test extraction/setup issue rather than a provider or module implementation issue. The test case requires:
1. A pre-existing managed disk to be created (likely from a related test like "diskOSImportManagedDisk")
2. The disk ID to be available before the VM can be created with `os_managed_disk_id`

Conclusion:
This test case is INVALID as a standalone test. It's designed as an update scenario within a multi-step test that would:
1. First create a VM with a managed disk
2. Then update that VM configuration

The extracted test configuration is missing the initial setup step and therefore cannot be executed independently.

Status: INVALID - Cannot run standalone, requires pre-existing managed disk
