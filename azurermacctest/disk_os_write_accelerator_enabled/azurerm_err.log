Test Case: disk_os_write_accelerator_enabled
================================================================================

Failed Command: terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false

Error Message:
Error: creating Windows Virtual Machine (Subscription: "f7a632a5-49db-4c5e-9828-cd62cb753971"
Resource Group Name: "acctestRG-418210"
Virtual Machine Name: "acctestvmwdd5j0"): performing CreateOrUpdate: unexpected status 409 (409 Conflict) with error:
OperationNotAllowed: Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved standardMSFamily Cores quota.
Additional details - Deployment Model: Resource Manager, Location: eastus, Current Limit: 0, Current Usage: 0, Additional Required: 8, (Minimum) New Limit Required: 8.

Root Cause Analysis:
The test case requires a Standard_M8ms VM size, which is part of the M-series (memory-optimized) family designed to support write accelerator features. However, the Azure subscription has a quota limit of 0 cores for standardMSFamily in the eastus region, and this test requires 8 cores.

This is an environmental limitation, not a configuration error. The write accelerator feature requires Premium Storage with specific VM sizes (M-series), and these VMs are not available in this subscription due to quota restrictions.

Conclusion:
Test case marked as "invalid" due to Azure subscription quota limitations. The configuration itself is correct, but cannot be deployed in the current environment.
