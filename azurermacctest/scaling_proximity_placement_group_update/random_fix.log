Test Case: scalingProximityPlacementGroupUpdate
================================================================================

Error: unable to assume default computer name "computer_name" can be at most 15 characters, got 17

Fix: Adjusted random_string length from 8 to 6 in main.tf to ensure VM name "acctestvmXXXXXX" stays within 15 character limit (9 + 6 = 15 characters)

Result: Success - VM created successfully after fix
