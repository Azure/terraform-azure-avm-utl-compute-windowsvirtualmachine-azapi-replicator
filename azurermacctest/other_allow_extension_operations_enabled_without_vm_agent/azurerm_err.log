Test Case: other_allow_extension_operations_enabled_without_vm_agent
================================================================================

Step 2 Failed - AzureRM Baseline Validation

Error:
llow_extension_operations cannot be set to 	rue when provision_vm_agent is set to alse

Configuration:
- allow_extension_operations = true
- provision_vm_agent = false

Conclusion:
This is an invalid configuration according to AzureRM provider validation rules.
The provider explicitly prohibits setting allow_extension_operations to true when 
provision_vm_agent is false. This test case cannot proceed as the baseline 
AzureRM configuration itself is invalid.

This appears to be testing an edge case or error condition that the provider 
actively prevents, making the test case invalid for migration testing purposes.
