Test Case: scaling_dedicated_host_update
================================================================================

Step 2 Failed - AzureRM Baseline Validation Failed

Failed Command:
terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false

Error:
Creating Dedicated Host failed with quota exceeded error:

Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved standardDSv3Family Cores quota. 
Additional details:
- Deployment Model: Resource Manager
- Location: eastus
- Current Limit: 65 cores
- Current Usage: 0 cores
- Additional Required: 80 cores (40 cores per dedicated host × 2 hosts)
- (Minimum) New Limit Required: 80 cores

Root Cause Analysis:
The test case requires creating two dedicated hosts of SKU "DSv3-Type3" (azurerm_dedicated_host.test and azurerm_dedicated_host.second).
Each DSv3-Type3 dedicated host requires 40 cores, totaling 80 cores.
The subscription has a quota limit of 65 cores for standardDSv3Family in the eastus region.

This is NOT a configuration issue that can be fixed by adjusting random resource lengths or parameters.
This is a fundamental Azure subscription quota limitation.

Conclusion:
The test case is marked as INVALID because it cannot be executed in the current subscription without increasing the quota.
This test requires Azure subscription quota increase for standardDSv3Family from 65 to at least 80 cores in the eastus region.

Cleanup:
Successfully destroyed all partially created resources (resource group, network infrastructure, dedicated host group).
No orphaned resources remaining.
