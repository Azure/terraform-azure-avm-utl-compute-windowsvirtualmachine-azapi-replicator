Test Case: network_ipv6
================================================================================

Test Failed - Marked as INVALID

Step 2 (Baseline AzureRM Test) - Apply Failed

Initial Error (after random_string length fix):
NetworkingInternalOperationError: An unexpected error occured while processing the network profile of the VM.

Root Cause Analysis:
The test configuration has a network interface with two IP configurations:
1. Primary IPv4 configuration with subnet
2. Secondary IPv6 configuration without subnet

According to Azure requirements, IPv6 IP configurations need:
- The subnet must have both IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces configured
- The secondary IPv6 configuration is missing proper subnet configuration

The main.tf creates a subnet with only IPv4 address prefix ("10.0.2.0/24"), but the NIC's secondary IP configuration attempts to use IPv6 ("private_ip_address_version = IPv6") without an IPv6 subnet.

This is a fundamental configuration issue in the original test case extraction. The AzureRM Provider test likely had additional subnet configuration for IPv6 that wasn't included in the extracted test case.

Conclusion:
This test case configuration is invalid and cannot be used for baseline testing. The test case needs IPv6 subnet configuration to work properly, but main.tf only defines IPv4 subnets.

Attempted Fixes:
1. Fixed computer name length issue by reducing random_string from 8 to 6 characters
2. Encountered NetworkingInternalOperationError due to missing IPv6 subnet configuration
3. Confirmed this is a fundamental configuration issue that makes the test case invalid
