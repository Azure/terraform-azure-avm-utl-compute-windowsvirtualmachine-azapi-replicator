Test Case: identity_user_assigned_updated
================================================================================

Initial Error:
The argument "resource_group_id" is required, but no definition was found.

Fix Process:

Attempt 1:
- Problem Analysis: The module requires resource_group_id parameter which was missing
- Fix Method: Added resource_group_id = azurerm_resource_group.test.id to module call
- Changes Made: Added resource_group_id parameter in azapi.tf
- Result: Revealed second error - admin_password_version validation

Attempt 2:
- Problem Analysis: When admin_password is set, admin_password_version must also be set per validation rule
- Fix Method: Added admin_password_version = 1 to module call
- Changes Made: Added admin_password_version parameter in azapi.tf
- Result: Success - terraform plan succeeded with acceptable drifts only

Final Result: Fix successful

Note: During Step 2 (baseline validation), encountered computer name length issue.
Fixed by reducing random_string.length from 8 to 5 in main.tf to ensure VM name
(acctestvmXXXXX) stays within 15-character limit for Windows computer names.
