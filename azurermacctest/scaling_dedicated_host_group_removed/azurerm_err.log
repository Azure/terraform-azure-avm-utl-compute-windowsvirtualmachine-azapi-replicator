Test Case: scaling_dedicated_host_group_removed
================================================================================

Step 2 (Baseline AzureRM Test) Failed - Test Marked as INVALID

Failed Command:
terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false

Root Cause:
Azure subscription quota limitation - insufficient cores for dedicated host deployment.

Error Details:
1. Primary Error: Quota Exceeded
   - Resource: Dedicated Host (azurerm_dedicated_host.second)
   - Required: 80 cores for standardDSv3Family
   - Current Limit: 65 cores
   - Current Usage: 0 cores
   - Location: eastus
   
   Full Error Message:
   "Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved standardDSv3Family 
   Cores quota. Additional details - Deployment Model: Resource Manager, Location: eastus, 
   Current Limit: 65, Current Usage: 0, Additional Required: 80, (Minimum) New Limit Required: 80."

2. Secondary Error: Computer Name Validation
   - Resource: azurerm_windows_virtual_machine.test
   - Error: "unable to assume default computer name 'computer_name' can be at most 15 characters, got 17"
   - Note: This is a random resource generation issue, but is not the primary blocker

Analysis:
This test case requires creating an Azure Dedicated Host with Standard_D2s_v3 SKU, which requires 
80 cores of standardDSv3Family quota. The test subscription only has a quota of 65 cores, making 
it impossible to create the required infrastructure.

This is consistent with other dedicated host tests in this test suite:
- scalingDedicatedHost: invalid (quota exceeded: 80 cores required, limit 65)
- scalingDedicatedHostUpdate: invalid (quota exceeded: 80 cores for 2 hosts, limit 65)
- scalingDedicatedHostRemoved: invalid (quota exceeded: 80 cores required, limit 65)
- scalingDedicatedHostGroup: invalid (quota exceeded: 80 cores required, limit 65)
- scalingDedicatedHostGroupUpdate: invalid (quota exceeded: 80 cores for 2 hosts, limit 65)

Conclusion:
The test case cannot be executed due to Azure subscription quota constraints. The test is marked 
as INVALID because the baseline AzureRM configuration cannot be deployed successfully, which is a 
prerequisite for testing the AzAPI conversion.

Recommendation:
To execute this test case, the Azure subscription would need a quota increase for standardDSv3Family 
cores from 65 to at least 80 cores in the eastus region.

Cleanup Status:
Successfully destroyed all partially created resources (resource group, network resources, dedicated host group).
No orphaned resources remaining.
