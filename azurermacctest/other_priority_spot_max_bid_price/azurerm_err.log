Test Case: other_priority_spot_max_bid_price
================================================================================

Step 2 Failed - AzureRM Baseline Validation

Failed Command: terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false

Error Message:
Error: creating Windows Virtual Machine (Subscription: "f7a632a5-49db-4c5e-9828-cd62cb753971"
Resource Group Name: "acctestRG-303471"
Virtual Machine Name: "acctestvm4mkuv"): performing CreateOrUpdate: unexpected status 409 (409 Conflict) with error: SkuNotAvailable: The requested VM size for resource 'Following SKUs have failed for Capacity Restrictions: Standard_F2' is currently not available in location 'eastus'. Please try another size or deploy to a different location or different zone. See https://aka.ms/azureskunotavailable for details.

Root Cause Analysis:
- Azure capacity constraint: Standard_F2 VM size is not available in eastus region
- This is an infrastructure limitation, not a test framework or module issue
- This is a Spot Priority VM with max_bid_price set to 0.5
- Spot VMs are subject to capacity availability and eviction policies

Note:
Fixed random_string length from 8 to 5 to satisfy computer name constraint (≤15 characters).
However, deployment still failed due to capacity constraints.

Conclusion:
Test case is invalid due to Azure capacity constraints for Standard_F2 Spot VMs in eastus region.
