Test Case: other_hotpatching_disabled
================================================================================

Initial Error:
Error: Missing required argument - The argument "resource_group_id" is required, but no definition was found.

Fix Process:

Attempt 1:
- Problem Analysis: The module requires resource_group_id but azapi.tf only has resource_group_name
- Fix Method: Add resource_group_id argument to module call
- Changes Made: Added resource_group_id = azurerm_resource_group.test.id to module call

Attempt 1:
- Result: Resolved resource_group_id error, but new error appeared

Attempt 2:
- Problem Analysis: Dynamic identity block in azapi_resource is trying to access null value
- Fix Method: Fix the dynamic block condition to properly check for identity
- Changes Made: Modified dynamic identity block to use a safer check

Attempt 2:
- Result: Plan succeeded with acceptable drifts detected

Final Result: Fix successful - All detected drifts are acceptable per acceptable_drift_patterns.md
- Resource-level attributes (ignore_null_property, locks, output, replace_triggers_external_values, sensitive_body_version, type) - all acceptable
- Body changes appear to be computed values being removed, which is expected with ignore_null_property = true
