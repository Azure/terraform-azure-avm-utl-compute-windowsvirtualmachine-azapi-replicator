Test Case: other_priority_spot

Error: unable to assume default computer name "computer_name" can be at most 15 characters, got 17. Please adjust the `name`, or specify an explicit `computer_name`

Fix: Reduced random_string.name length from 8 to 6 characters in main.tf
- Original: length = 8 (resulted in 17 char VM name: "acctestvm" + 8 chars)
- Fixed: length = 6 (results in 15 char VM name: "acctestvm" + 6 chars)

Result: Random resource fix successful, but subsequent SKU capacity error occurred
