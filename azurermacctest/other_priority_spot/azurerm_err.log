Step 2 - Baseline AzureRM Configuration Test Failed

Failed Command: terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false

Error:
creating Windows Virtual Machine (Subscription: "f7a632a5-49db-4c5e-9828-cd62cb753971"
Resource Group Name: "acctestRG-232091"
Virtual Machine Name: "acctestvm2wc5m3"): performing CreateOrUpdate: unexpected status 409 (409 Conflict) with error:
SkuNotAvailable: The requested VM size for resource 'Following SKUs have failed for Capacity Restrictions: Standard_F2'
is currently not available in location 'eastus'. Please try another size or deploy to a different location or different
zone. See https://aka.ms/azureskunotavailable for details.

Root Cause Analysis:
The Standard_F2 VM size is not available in the eastus region due to capacity restrictions. This is an Azure platform
capacity issue, not a Terraform configuration error. Spot VMs have additional capacity constraints compared to regular VMs.

Note:
A random resource constraint (computer_name length) was identified and fixed by reducing random_string.name length from 8 to 6 characters.
This fix was documented in random_fix.log.

Conclusion:
The test case cannot proceed due to Azure capacity limitations for the Standard_F2 Spot VM SKU in the eastus region.
This test should be marked as 'invalid' as it cannot validate the baseline AzureRM configuration.
